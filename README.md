# Historian · Digital Humanist · Data Scientist in training

__Hi, my name is Cao Vy !__

At the intersection of history and data science, I combine humanities inquiry with computational methods to explore the history of books, printing, and publishing in colonial contexts — particularly in French Cochinchina (1890–1945). My research engages with the material and epistemological dimensions of knowledge production, with a strong focus on multilingual corpora.

Currently, I design and develop digital methods to interrogate colonial archives and enhance the accessibility of extra-European collections. I am also exploring the use of machine learning and data science to support semantic enrichment, OCR correction, and data extraction from complex textual corpora.

### Research Focus
- Book history, publishing networks, and textual circulation in colonial Vietnam
- Metadata cleaning and remediation for non-European collections
- Semantic analysis, multilingual NLP, and knowledge graph modeling

### Current Projects
- InVisto (2022–2025): Relational database on books and printing in colonial Vietnam
- Rag’it! (2025): Semantic annotation and knowledge graph construction from OCR-processed corpora
